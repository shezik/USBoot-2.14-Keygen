# USBoot 2.14 Keygen
[USBoot.org](https://www.usboot.org) has been down for quite a long time, so here you go.

You can download the latest version of USBoot at [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20171024160614/https://www.usboot.org/tiki-index.php?page=download).

By the way, all the strings in the main executable are encrypted. Nasty stuff. Plenty of options hidden inside.

And I can't help but wonder: did Gerd Rös write a full-fledged script engine just for the USBoot project??
